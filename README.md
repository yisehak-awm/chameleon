# ðŸ¦Ž Chameleon
A telegram bot that allows multiple players to play the game "Chameleon"

TODO
* Currently the bot requires the memebers to post their hints and argue their points either in a chat group or in person. Have the bot ask players to give their hints in random order and let players discuss afterwards until the admin hits "Reveal chameleon". This allows players to play without having to meet in person and without the need for a separate group chat.
